For a black belt:

You must be able to deploy your work to Amazon EC2 and provide the IP address or subdomain/domain name to where your work has been deployed
 Please note that Heroku deployment is not honored
Include the bottom table on the dashboard for joined trips
A user may join trips that other users created
Joining a trip moves the trip from the bottom table to the top table
Users may cancel a trip they joined, which means they no longer wish to go on the trip and the trip moves back to the bottom table
Include date validations when creating and editing trips
Trips must take place in the future
Trips must end after they begin
Show flash messages informing the user if they attempt to time travel
In the trip details, display who is joining the trip
Do not include the creator of the trip as someone who joined the trip
Also:
If you are using Flask, include a file with the SQL script to create your database (this can be copied when you forward engineer your ERD)
Remove your github repo after deploying.

What the prompts are asking for. Just ask if you are unsure about what the goals are!
